# 📱 note-to-ai: Your Personal AI Assistant via Signal

> **Transform your Signal "Note to Self" into a powerful AI-powered knowledge base**

Turn every voice message, text, and thought you send to yourself on Signal into an intelligently searchable, AI-enhanced personal knowledge system. Built with quantum-resistant cryptography, local AI models, and distributed storage.

## 🔥 **The Problem This Solves**

**Signal's "Note to Self" is powerful but limited:**
- ✗ Voice messages pile up with no transcription
- ✗ Important thoughts get lost in the timeline  
- ✗ No way to search across all your notes intelligently
- ✗ Can't ask questions about your accumulated knowledge
- ✗ No connections between related ideas

**note-to-ai transforms this into your personal AI assistant:**
- ✅ **Automatic transcription** of voice messages using local Whisper
- ✅ **Intelligent search** across all your notes using semantic AI
- ✅ **Ask questions** about your knowledge with local LLMs (Hermes/Llama)
- ✅ **Privacy-first** - everything runs locally, encrypted with quantum-resistant crypto
- ✅ **Cross-device sync** via private IPFS swarm
- ✅ **Obsidian integration** for power users who want markdown files

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### 1. **Setup Signal Integration**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/D8N1/note-to-ai.git
cd note-to-ai

# Run setup script (downloads models, configures Signal)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Configure your Signal credentials
cp config/.env.template .env
# Edit .env with your Signal phone number and registration
```

### 2. **Send Your First AI Note**
1. Open Signal → "Note to Self" 
2. Send a voice message: *"Remind me that I need to research hybrid databases for the project"*
3. Watch as note-to-ai:
   - 🎤 **Transcribes** your voice using local Whisper
   - 🧠 **Generates embeddings** for semantic search
   - 💾 **Stores** in encrypted local database
   - 🔍 **Makes it searchable** alongside all your other notes

### 3. **Query Your Knowledge**
Send text messages to yourself like:
- *"What did I say about databases?"*
- *"Show me notes about the project from last week"*
- *"What were my thoughts on the meeting with John?"*

The AI will search through **ALL** your notes and respond with relevant information!

## ❓ **FAQ**

### **Q: How is this different from ChatGPT/Claude?**
**A:** Those are generic AI assistants. note-to-ai learns YOUR specific knowledge, thoughts, and context from your personal Signal notes. It's like having a conversation with your past self.

### **Q: Why Signal and not WhatsApp/Telegram?**
**A:** Signal has the strongest privacy model, open-source protocol, and "Note to Self" is perfect for personal knowledge capture. Plus, Signal's encryption + our quantum-resistant crypto = maximum security.

### **Q: Can I use my existing Obsidian vault?**  
**A:** Yes! note-to-ai can import/export to Obsidian format and sync in real-time. Keep using Obsidian for structured note-taking while using Signal for quick voice capture.

### **Q: What about battery life on mobile?**
**A:** The heavy AI processing runs on your computer/server, not your phone. Your phone just sends/receives Signal messages normally.

### **Q: How much storage does this use?**
**A:** Models: ~17GB one-time. Your notes: Very efficient with hybrid storage. 10,000 notes ≈ 500MB including full-text search and vectors.
